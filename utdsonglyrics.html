    <h3><a name="freetobe">Free To Be </a></h3>
    <p>I'm not swayed by the way people judge by what they see</br>
        Not dismayed by the words, I overcome adversity</br>
        My path is made by a truth that I believe...</br>
        I'm free to be.
    </p>
    <p>I'll not conform to the standards those before</br>
        have set for me. </br>
        I'll rage and storm. A worthy life</br>
        doesn't come that easily.</br>
        Because I was born, to fulfill my own destiny</br>
        I'm free to be.
    </p>
    <p>I'm free to be what I want</br>
        to choose, what I please to do. </br>
        Not to follow what another believes.
        I'll never take for granted what that really means...</br>
        I'm free to be.
    </p>

    <p>You can't change those around you</br>
        just cause you don't like their ways.</br>
        Can't arrange other people like characters</br>
        in a play. Embrace the strange</br>
        Differences are the beauty of today</br>
        they're free to be.
    </p>
    <p>They're free to be what they want</br>
        to choose, what they please to do. </br>
        Not to follow what another believes.</br>
        That freedom cannot be taken easily</br>
        They're free to be
    </p>
    <p>So no matter your race, who you love</br>
        or where you place your faith</br>
        show your strength and live the truth</br>
        that you believe
    </p>
    <p>We're free to be what we want</br>
        to choose, what we please to do.</br>
        Not to follow what another believes.</br>
        To live and let others follow their own dreams
    </p>
    <p>You're free to live your own life</br>
        To make your own choice. To NEVER</br>
        give others the use of your voice</br>
        So put your hands up if you know what it means</br>
        to Be Free.
    </p>

    <h3><a name="thismoment">This Moment </a></h3>

    <p>A hallowed night filled with sinnin'</br>
        he took my hand felt my head spinnin'.</br>
        Then we raced through the door, under the sky</br>
        my eyes met yours.
    </p>
    <p>We're hangin on this moment and there is nothing</br>
        but fever and moonlight. </br>
        We're chasing down a feeling lost </br>
        inside the rhythm.
    </p>
    <p>...A hard pause before the dam breaks.</br>
        Feet on the ground I felt the earth shake.</br>
        You always say you wanna misbehave </br>
        you lead I'll follow...come what may.
    </p>
    <p>We're hangin on this moment and there is nothing</br>
        but fever and moonlight. </br>
        We're chasing down a feeling lost </br>
        inside the rhythm of our hearts.
    </p>
    <p>We could be the fire burning in the night,</br>
    skin flushed with desire, put your hand in mine.
    </p>
    <p>We're hangin on this moment and there is nothing</br>
        but fever and moonlight. </br>
        We're chasing down a feeling lost </br>
        inside the rhythm of our hearts.
    </p>
    <p>We're hanging on this moment.</br>
    We're chasing down a feeling.</br>
    We're lost inside the rhythm.
