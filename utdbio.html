        <p> This is what the modest biography on the facebook page states.
        However we have made it easy here to get more in depth about the band</br>
         and the things we do outside of just playing music together.</p>
<h3>Current Biography</h3>

        <a href="#Madison">Madison Lewis</a>, the group's lead vocalist, hails from Orange County, CA. A voice all her own, </br>
        she pours her soul into live performances with an audience large or small. </br>
        <a href="#Benzo">Benjamin "Benzo" Zoleski</a> plays guitars. A music major from Berklee, Ben brings a great range to </br>
        the guitar and vocals along with an amazing positive energy and stage presence. The rhythm section is comprised of identical twin </br>
        brothers <a href="#solo">John Nowak</a> (on bass) and drummer <a href="#jayno">Jason "J NO" Nowak</a>. Both have a long musical history </br>
