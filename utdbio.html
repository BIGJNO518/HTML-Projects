        <h1 class="body" ><a name="Madison">Madison Lewis</a></h1>
        <img src="maddy.jpg" alt="Madison Lewis" width="275" height="350"/>
        <p class="body">Madison Lewis keeps busy inside the music industry and out. </br>
            She is constantly volunteering time to help in local charities, support local business,</br>
            and check out others in the great upstate music scene. You can see her at Albany's</br>
            "The Barn" artist lofts, judging musical competitions locally, or recording with other</br>
            artists and friends. She enjoys a great brunch and spending time with family, and is a little</br>
            too nerdy about Star Wars. Her major musical influences include Prince, Shania Twain,
            Brand New, and Guns N Roses. </br>
        </p>
        <h1 class="body" ><a name="Benzo">Benzo</a></h1>
        <img src="The boys.jpg" alt="Ben Zoleski" width="275" height="350"/>
        <p class="ben">Ben is the youngest in the band, but he has a rich background</br>
            playing many shows with many different types of bands inlcuding The Refrigerators</br>
            and C.K Flach. He enjoys teaching music when not rocking or creating, which is why
            he graduated from Berklee School of Music with a degree in Music Instruction. </br>
            Ben was recently picked up as a Musical Director and player for the touring production </br>
            of Andrew Lloyd Webber's "School of Rock", and will be joining the band again in 2019. </br>
            Ben plays exclusively Moniker guitars, Marshall Amps, and D'Addario strings. His major </br>
            musical influences range from B.B King, to Micheal Jackson, to Hawthorne Heights. He also
            loves spending time with his cat and a good New York A.P.A.
        </p>
        <h1 class="body" ><a name="solo">John Nowak</a></h1>
        <img src="solo.jpg" alt="John 'Solo' Nowak" width="400" height="350"/>
        <p class="solo">John Nowak has been playing bass for a number of years.</br>
            Writing much of the material, and driving the pace of the music, his</br>
            sense of the dancefloor from being a Drum n Bass DJ ("SOLO") shines in</br>
            the thumping "4 on the floor" grooves in tracks like "All That Talk" or</br>
            "The Spark". His history of rocking decks as well as the bass allows</br>
            for more musicality in the band. His influences range from Coheed and Cambria</br>
            to outlaw Country like Willie, Waylon, and David Allen Coe, to Teenage Bottle Rocket,</br>
            David Bowie, John Digweed, and much more. John is also heavily involved with </br>
            Malcolm's Restaurant in Schenectady.

        <h1 class="body" ><a name="jayno">Jason "JNO" Nowak</a></h1>
        <img src="jayrooftop.jpg" alt="Jason Nowak" width="420" height="350"/>
        <p class="jayno">Jason Nowak has been playing drums around the capital region and abroad
            for many years. He started in the hardcore/punk scene of Upstate Ny in the late 90's
            playing for most notably Endicott (Equal Vision Records). Since then he has gone on
            to play for many other projects of various genres. Jason also spends time coding and
            has recently returned to college to pursue a BS in Computer Programming. Jason plays
            Truth Drums and loves his Paiste cymbals. His musical influences would be Candiria,
            the Police, Daft Punk, and many more.
